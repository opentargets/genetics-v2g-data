Old to new biofeature label mappings
====================================

In genetics portal release 6, we updated to new data from the eQTL catalogue. In these data, many of the biofeature labels were changed. This makes it hard to compare data from previous releases, such as colocalisation results, with new data. (We might want to do this to check for consistency of our results, for example.) The files in this folder have some mappings from old to new labels.
